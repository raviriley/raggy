## Guidelines

Please note that GitHub issues are only meant for bug reports/feature requests. 
If you have questions on how to use Neo4j, please ask on [Neo4j Community](https://community.neo4j.com/) or [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/neo4j) instead of creating an issue here.

To help us understand your issue, please specify important details, primarily:

- **Steps to reproduce**. *Not including reproduction steps will mean your bug will take considerably longer to investigate and fix. Please don't skip this*.
- Expected behaviour
- Actual behaviour
- Neo4j image tag being used, eg `neo4j:latest`, `neo4j:enterprise-3.5` etc
- The output of the `docker version` command
- Operating system: (for example Windows 95/Ubuntu 16.04)

Additionally, include (as appropriate) error messages, log-files, stacktraces, and other debug output.
